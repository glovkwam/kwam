          Hello my name is Kwame and I am a 21 year old web developer living in
          San Leandro, California. I am currently attending San Jose State
          Univeristy. I started at SJSU as a business major but I have recently
          decided to change my major to Digital Media Art. So far, I have earned
          my minor in general business minor and am working towards getting my
          BFA in Digital Media Art. In my spare time, I enjoy making youtube
          videos about cryptocurrency and am interested in the idea of
          decentralized finance. I am also learning the basics of web
          development including programs such as Python and JavaScript.

                Fun Fact: Laughter is an important action that we as humans
                overlook on a daily basis. We may not think about laughter as
                something essential to huamn health but it acutally is quite
                important. It has been seen that there is a considerabele drop
                in the levels of stress hormones after a good laughing session!

          This image was made using Adobe Photoshop in 2020. It is title "Animal
          Sanctuary" and is supposed to represent what North America would look
          like if big cats roamed free out in the wild. This project highlights
          what nature could look like if human beings didn't intervene or
          traverse the natural habitats of endagered animals.
